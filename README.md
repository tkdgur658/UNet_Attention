# GTSNet: Flexible Architecture under Budget Constraint for Real-Time Human Activity Recognition from Wearable Sensor

## Abstract
This program (GTSNet) is designed to perform the real-time sensor-based activity recognition. The GTSNet includes a Grouped Temporal Shift (GTS) module that allows the network architecture to be flexibly modified by predefining the theoretical computational cost.
This software is a PyTorch implementation of the proposed method. The original version of this program was written by Jaegyun Park.
